# Youtube-Video-Summarizer

## Project Overview:
The project aims to create a basic version of a YouTube video summarizer using cutting-edge AI technologies. Inspired by the impressive responses of Gemini during GDSC GenAI Study Jam labs, particularly in handling small videos and images, We are curious to explore the possibility of summarizing longer YouTube videos. This idea was further fueled by our sessions on using genAI for video analytics with Vertex AI during our Code Vipassana sessions, which encouraged us to embark on this independent project.
